<h3> INTRODUCTION
<p>1. Reason for choosing the topic
There are several compelling reasons for selecting the topic of "Tomato Leaf Diseases Diagnosis based on K-means Clustering and Deep Learning." Firstly, tomato plants are highly susceptible to various diseases, which can significantly impact their growth and yield. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of these diseases are crucial for implementing timely and effective control measures, thereby minimizing crop losses and ensuring sustainable tomato production. Secondly, traditional methods of disease diagnosis in tomato plants often rely on visual inspection by experts, which can be subjective and time-consuming. 
Therefore, in this research, our team has chosen the topic of Image Classification using the enhanced approach based on K-means clustering and deep learning. Specifically, we rely on the scientific paper titled "Corn Leaf Diseases Diagnosis Based on K-Means Clustering and Deep Learning [1]" as a research objective. We conduct an in-depth study of the research work conducted by the authors in order to gain knowledge and a profound understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks in general, along with K-means clustering and the proposed model by the authors in particular.

2. Research subjects
The research focuses on images of tomato leaves, which are classified into three categories: late blight disease, two-spotted spider mite disease, and tomato yellow leaf curl virus disease.</p>
