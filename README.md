<p> INTRODUCTION
1. Reason for choosing the topic
There are several compelling reasons for selecting the topic of "Tomato Leaf Diseases Diagnosis based on K-means Clustering and Deep Learning." Firstly, tomato plants are highly susceptible to various diseases, which can significantly impact their growth and yield. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of these diseases are crucial for implementing timely and effective control measures, thereby minimizing crop losses and ensuring sustainable tomato production. Secondly, traditional methods of disease diagnosis in tomato plants often rely on visual inspection by experts, which can be subjective and time-consuming. 
Nowadays, Information Technology (IT) is gradually proving its significant impact on every aspect of social life. In the field of agriculture, it is evident that IT plays an increasingly important role, not only supporting the research process of equipment and farming tools but also facilitating the successful implementation and application of advanced techniques in source tracing, component analysis, and automation tasks. Furthermore, it contributes to research and development in chemicals, fertilizers, and pest control. With high accuracy and maximum cost savings, IT is also applied in classification problems, particularly image classification. When it comes to classification, we are familiar with various algorithms such as Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, or Linear Classifiers. However, their limitations arise when applied to image problems, as they require a large dataset with numerous data points, leading to the handling of a massive amount of data. Treating image data like other types is infeasible as it fails to capture spatial correlations among objects in the image, resulting in inaccurate outcomes.
Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as one of the advanced classification models. Stemming from the Deep Learning framework, Convolutional Neural Networks are highly accurate algorithmic systems. Currently, CNNs are widely utilized in intelligent and flexible image recognition, enabling the construction of highly accurate intelligent systems.
Therefore, in this research, our team has chosen the topic of Image Classification using the enhanced approach based on K-means clustering and deep learning. Specifically, we rely on the scientific paper titled "Corn Leaf Diseases Diagnosis Based on K-Means Clustering and Deep Learning [1]" as a research objective. We conduct an in-depth study of the research work conducted by the authors in order to gain knowledge and a profound understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks in general, along with K-means clustering and the proposed model by the authors in particular.
